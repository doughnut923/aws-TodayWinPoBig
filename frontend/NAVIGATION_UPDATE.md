# Navigation Flow Update Summary

## Changes Made

The authentication flow has been updated so that after clicking the **Sign In** button, users are automatically directed to the user data collection pages.

### Key Updates:

1. **Authentication Context** (`AppNavigator.js`):
   - Added React Context for managing authentication state
   - Created `useAuth` hook for accessing authentication methods
   - Added state management for `isAuthenticated` and `hasCompletedOnboarding`

2. **Login Screen** (`LoginScreen.js`):
   - Imported and used the `useAuth` hook
   - Updated the `handleLogin` function to call `login()` instead of showing an alert
   - After successful login, user is automatically navigated to user data collection

3. **Signup Screen** (`SignupScreen.js`):
   - Imported and used the `useAuth` hook
   - Updated the `handleSignup` function to call `login()` instead of showing an alert
   - After successful signup, user is automatically navigated to user data collection

4. **Goals Screen** (`UserInfoGoalsScreen.js`):
   - Imported and used the `useAuth` hook
   - Updated the `handleFinish` function to call `completeOnboarding()`
   - After completing goals selection, user is automatically navigated to the main app

## Updated Flow:

1. **User starts at Login Screen**
2. **User enters credentials and clicks "Sign In"**
3. **→ User is automatically navigated to Name collection screen**
4. **User completes the 4-step onboarding process:**
   - Name collection
   - Age input
   - Physical information (weight/height)
   - Goals selection
5. **→ User is automatically navigated to the main Homepage**

## Testing Instructions:

1. Open the app (scan QR code or press 'w' for web)
2. You'll see the Login screen
3. Enter any email (e.g., `test@example.com`) and password (minimum 6 characters)
4. Click "Sign In"
5. **You should immediately be taken to the Name collection screen**
6. Complete the onboarding flow:
   - Enter first and last name → Click "Next"
   - Enter age → Click "Next" 
   - Enter weight and height → Click "Next"
   - Select a goal → Click "Complete Setup"
7. **You should be taken to the Homepage with meal recommendations**

## No More Alert Popups:

- Previously, successful login/signup showed alert popups
- Now, the navigation happens automatically and seamlessly
- This provides a much smoother user experience

The app is currently running and ready for testing!
