## Introduction

Nutri2Go is a mobile food delivery application that combines¬†**convenience with healthy eating**¬†by providing personalized meal recommendations based on users' health goals.

## Problem Statement‚ùì

Living in Hong Kong is not easy, with its fast-paced lifestyle, long working hours, and limited time for home-cooked meals, people often sacrifice nutrition for convenience. This leads to unhealthy eating habits, inconsistent diets, and difficulty in achieving fitness or wellness goals. 

In fact, this trend could be supported by data: 

- Hong Kong office workers often have short lunch breaks (sometimes as short as **30 minutes**), making convenience a **top priority for lunch choices**, with many opting for **quick meals or food delivery to maximize break time**
- Only about **3% of Hong Kong** adults consume the recommended five or more servings of fruits and vegetables daily, with many **falling short of this healthier diet guideline**
- Despite some resurgence in dine-in dining post-pandemic, **59%-65%** of restaurants still report **significant revenue** from takeaway or delivery, highlighting that a considerable portion customers **relies heavily on food delivery services** alongside dining in.

Thus the challenge is clear:¬†**how can busy urban professionals enjoy the speed and ease of food delivery while staying aligned with their personal health objectives?**
